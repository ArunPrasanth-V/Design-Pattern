# singleton Pattern
------
-```The Singleton pattern is used when we want to ensure that there is only one instance of a class throughout the entire application, and that this instance is easily accessible to all parts of the application.```

```There are several reasons why we might need the Singleton pattern:```
- ```1. Resource sharing: If there is a limited resource, such as a database connection or a file system, we can use the Singleton pattern to ensure that this resource is shared by all parts of the application.```
- ```2.Global state management: If we have a global state that needs to be accessed and modified by multiple parts of the application, we can use the Singleton pattern to ensure that this state is easily accessible and that changes made to it are consistent across the entire application.```
- ```3.Performance optimization: If creating new objects of a particular class is expensive, we can use the Singleton pattern to reuse an existing instance instead of creating a new one every time.```
- ```4.Ensuring consistency: If we want to ensure that a particular class is instantiated only once and that all instances are identical, we can use the Singleton pattern to ensure consistency across the entire application.```
- # Overall, the Singleton pattern is a useful tool for managing global resources and state in a way that is easy to access and maintain throughout the entire application.

# Example
------
```
public class DatabaseConnection {
    private static DatabaseConnection instance;
    
    private DatabaseConnection() {
        // private constructor to prevent instantiation from outside
    }
    
    public static DatabaseConnection getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new DatabaseConnection();
        }
        return instance;
    }
    
    public void connect() {
        // connect to database
    }
}
```
- ``` In this implementation, we have a private static variable instance which holds the single instance of the DatabaseConnection class. The constructor is made private to prevent instantiation of the class from outside.```
- ``` The getInstance() method is a static method that returns the single instance of the DatabaseConnection class. When the getInstance() method is called, it checks whether the instance variable is already set. If it is not set, then a new instance of the class is created and set to the instance variable. If it is already set, then it simply returns the existing instance.```
- ``` The connect() method is a public method that can be called on the singleton instance to connect to the database.```
